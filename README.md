# Exoplanet Classification with Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to classify exoplanets using physical and orbital data from NASA’s Exoplanet Archive. The goal is to identify patterns in confirmed exoplanets and predict planet types such as Gas Giants, Neptune-like planets, Super-Earths, and Terrestrial planets.

## Scientific Motivation
With thousands of confirmed exoplanets, manual classification is no longer practical. Machine learning allows astronomers to analyze large datasets efficiently and uncover relationships between planetary properties and formation outcomes.

## Dataset
Source: NASA Exoplanet Archive  
Dataset: Planetary Systems Composite Parameters  
Format: CSV

Key features include:
- Planet radius
- Planet mass
- Orbital period
- Stellar effective temperature
- Equilibrium temperature
- Insolation flux

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection
- Random Forest classification
- Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrices
- Feature importance analysis

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Expected Outcomes
- A trained machine learning model that classifies exoplanet types
- Visualization of important planetary features
- Insights into which parameters most influence planet classification
